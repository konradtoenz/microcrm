# Micro CRM

This is a little demo application simulating a CRM tool.
It's based on Spring Boot and has a simple web frontend.

Built it with `gradlew assemble` (resulting in a runnable jar in `build/libs`),
or run it directly with `gradlew bootRun`.

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.
